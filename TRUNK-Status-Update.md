# TRUNK Project Status Update

From the Founder

After careful consideration of the current challenges facing TRUNK, I want to share my perspective on where the project stands, and where it will likely go from here.

## Current Challenges

TRUNK has reached a juncture with several significant obstacles:

1. **Limited Funding**: The project has no substantial funding beyond TRUNK tokens themselves. As mentioned in community discussions: TRUNK does not have a fair market value outside of AO's DEXs, so using it for direct funding is limited. The project also does not have funds to pair with it on DEXs for further pool expansion as it has not been funded by any VCs or seed round(current pool depth is supported by fees earned from past trading volume). It wasn’t intended to take that route in the beginning.
2. **Technical Infrastructure/Migration to HyperBEAM**: The front-end requires a complete rebuild as dryruns are being phased out and this is already causing issues with using the staking features. The token needs to be migrated to Hyperbeam with many potential changes in the future.
3. **Concentrated Token Distribution**: The 50,000 token supply is highly concentrated as the top 20 holders hold **MORE THAN 50% of total supply**, creating a high-risk asset for exchange listings without significant compensation(CEX listings cost around $50k on average). The only way to solve this is either minting a lot more TRUNK so current holdings don’t represent a large portion of supply anymore, or those tokens are sold into the market pools but current pool depth couldn’t support this and it would centralize supply to LP owners. Neither option seem viable currently.

These challenges are preventing TRUNK from progressing into larger markets, and currently the ecosystem is shrinking despite recent marketing efforts. The reality is this will require an extensive rebuild of the entire project—from the smart contract/token to the front-end interface and staking setup.

This comprehensive overhaul takes an immense amount of work and time, all for a token that remains extremely high-risk due to its concentrated distribution. These issues stem from the initial launch being very niche and limited in scope, as it was meant originally to just test functionality out with tokens on AO in different capacities.

I do not currently have the bandwidth to dedicate to a project rebuild of this magnitude, especially when other fundamental issues would continue to hinder adoption of it afterwards. The tokenomics present a significant barrier for many and would likely discourage new users, even after addressing the contract upgrades/Hyperbeam migration, and front-end reconstruction. 

## Returning Allocated Marketing Funds

To address any possible community concerns, all allocated TRUNK tokens not used for direct marketing purposes have been returned to the DAO. This includes 1,200 TRUNK previously paid to myself for marketing work and the remaining 1,980 TRUNK in the team-designated wallet. These funds have been returned even though I have performed marketing work as promised with the 3-6 month timeline(starting in January 2025). [Original DAO proposal here](https://cw4qfq7vwti2n5hpukpumwkmdhokqioqnc42hbtb2lzcagnbimfa.arweave.net/FbkCw_W00ab076KfRllMGdyoIdBouaOGYdLyIBmhQwo)  
Our funding consisted solely of TRUNK tokens, which significantly limited our options and what we could do. As discussed with community members, most marketing avenues remained closed since external marketers were unwilling to accept TRUNK as payment. Additionally, using these tokens to fund any team operations would have required selling them, potentially harming the small market of existing holders. 
Despite these constraints, I pursued several marketing initiatives including the “TRUMP” trading competition and attendance at ETHDenver but ultimately saw little community growth and engagement over that period so subsequently decided to return the TRUNK allotments.

## Going Forward

TRUNK has been a trail blazer- paving the way for other projects to onboard to many new apps and ideas throughout the AO ecosystem from post tipping on TYPR to the first AO token pools on Permaswap.

The TRUNK token and DAO will continue to exist as Arweave/AO are permanent.
Going Forward:

1. The permaweb site will remain up at https://trunk-on-ao.ar.io but will not receive further updates in it’s current form.
    All manual staking/unstaking commands and other features can be found in the [TRUNK repo readme](https://github.com/Jonny-Ringo/TRUNK/blob/main/README.md).
2. The token contract will remain live at `wOrb8b_V8QixWyXZub48Ki5B6OIDyf_p1ngoonsaRpQ` on AO Legacynet(testnet)
3. The 12 AO received from the original CRED minting of TRUNK have been used to create a pool on Botega and paired with 144 TRUNK.

4. Current LP tokens have been burned. This means the current pools are permanent.

5. The 1200 TRUNK paid to the team for marketing, and subsequent remaining budget of 1980 TRUNK have been returned to the DAO. Some of the DAO marketing allocation was used for the [“TRUMP” trading competition](https://x.com/TrunkToken/status/1882161312652018049) and this is why the full 2300 is not available to return. 0 tokens were sold by the team wallet.

I'm grateful for what this project has taught me, and I'm confident that many other projects in the space have benefitted from it’s imprint here. Thank you to everyone who has been apart of this incredible journey!
